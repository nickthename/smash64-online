Configure your ROM Directory \u00b6 Open Project64KSE.exe and select your ROM directory (where your ROM is located). Select your Plugins \u00b6 Graphics \u00b6 GLideN64 Public Release 4.0 Recommended OpenGL \u00b6 The most accurate and best looking plugin, but usually crashes the emulator when ending emulation. GLideN64 Public Release 2.0 OpenGL \u00b6 Correctly renders most things in-game and does not crash the emulator when ending emulation. Jabo\u2019s Direct3D8 1.6 DirectX \u00b6 Older plugin that uses less resources than GLideN64, but has visual glitches (does not show invincibility). Only use if you can\u2019t run GLideN64 or OpenGL. Audio \u00b6 Azimer's Audio v0.30 (Old Driver) Recommended \u00b6 Standard audio plugin. Other audio plugins may cause desyncs. It is recommended to reduce Buffer Size so game audio is less delayed. This is not saved and must be done every emulator restart. No Sound \u00b6 Simple audio plugin that disables sound entirely. Does not seem to cause desyncs. Controller \u00b6 raphnetraw 1 player NET version Recommended Original Hori \u00b6 Best plug and play adapter for original and hori controllers. Both single and dual port versions work. No configuration necessary. For offline multiplayer use raphnetraw for Project64 version .

You must map your own buttons, and enable RAW data . Cheats \u00b6 Make sure the 1. Netplay Required cheat is checked when you set up Project64KSE for the first time. This is a one time process and does not need to be done every time you launch the emulator. Start the game first to apply the cheat. If you use cheats other than 1. Netplay Required you may need to recheck your cheats every time you launch the game. Start Netplay \u00b6 A netplay game can either be via Server or P2P . Higher ping causes higher frame delay. Most players will play on 2 frames or less, some may tolerate 3 frames. You must restart the emulator if another player is joining or any player changes port. Servers may sometimes go down and active servers may be found on the master server list. Connecting via Server \u00b6 Join server Host or join lobbies to play Host starts game Up to 4 players can play Connecting via P2P \u00b6 Host must have ports forwarded and provide external IP to other player Both players tick Ready to start the game Up to 2 players can play Questions \u00b6 If you are still having trouble ask in #help in the main Smash64 discord.
